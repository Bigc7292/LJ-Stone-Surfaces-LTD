1. High-End AI Feature IdeasThe "Visionary" Room Re-ImagerThis is your "upload a photo" idea, but elevated. Instead of a simple overlay, use Generative AI (Stable Diffusion/Inpainting).The Experience: A user uploads a photo of their dated kitchen. The AI identifies the existing countertops and replaces them with your specific stone textures (e.g., Calacatta Borghini) while adjusting for the actual lighting and shadows of their room.AI Stone Concierge (Voice & Text)Standard chatbots feel cheap. A luxury concierge should be powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT-4, trained specifically on your inventory.The Experience: "I’m looking for something durable like granite but with the dramatic veining of marble for a high-traffic kitchen." The AI doesn't just link to a page; it explains why a specific Quartzite is the perfect middle ground.Augmented Reality (AR) Slab ViewerStone is tactile. Since you provide fitting services, use AR to help them "place" a 1:1 scale slab in their space.The Experience: Using their phone camera, the user can see a high-resolution 3D scan of a specific slab from your yard projected onto their floor or island to check how the pattern flow (veining) works with their cabinetry.Intelligent "Vein-Match" VisualizerFor luxury clients, the "bookmatch" (how veins line up at seams) is critical.The Experience: An interactive tool where users can drag and drop two slabs to see how the patterns align at a joint or waterfall edge.2. Replit Development PromptsTo build these in Replit, it is best to use a React/Next.js frontend with a Python/Flask or Node.js backend. Below are detailed prompts for the "Replit Agent" or for you to use in the Replit editor.Prompt A: The "Visionary" AI Room Uploader"Create a high-end Next.js application for a luxury stone company. Build a 'Room Visualizer' feature where users can upload an image of their kitchen. Integrate a frontend canvas where the user can click to 'mask' their current countertop. Use a placeholder API call to an AI image service (like Replicate or OpenAI DALL-E 3) that takes the uploaded image and the mask, and performs 'Inpainting' to replace the countertop with a high-resolution marble texture. The UI should be minimalist, using dark mode, gold accents, and elegant typography (serif fonts for headings)."Prompt B: The AI Stone Concierge (LLM)"Develop a specialized AI Chatbot component using React and the OpenAI API. The chatbot should act as a 'Luxury Stone Consultant.' Create a system prompt that instructs the AI to be professional, knowledgeable about stone types (Mohs hardness, porosity, veining types), and helpful with fitting/installation advice. The chat interface should be a sleek, slide-out drawer with a glassmorphism effect. Include 'Quick Inquiry' buttons for 'Request a Quote' or 'Book a Measurement' that trigger a contact form."Prompt C: Interactive Slab Gallery & Filter"Build a 'Stone Discovery' gallery using Tailwind CSS. The gallery should have an AI-powered 'Mood Filter.' Instead of just checkboxes, include a text input where users can type: 'I want something dark and moody for a primary bath' or 'Light and airy with gold veins.' Use a basic vector search logic (or a simple keyword mapping for now) to filter a JSON array of stone products. Each product card should have a 'View in My Room' button that initiates the upload flow from Prompt A."3.

Ensure your AI images generate in under 5 seconds, or use a beautiful "polishing the stone" loading animation to keep the user engaged.Would you like me to generate the specific System Prompt you should use for the AI Stone Concierge to make it sound like a professional interior designer?
