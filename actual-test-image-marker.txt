// This file is a placeholder for the binary data of the uploaded test image.
// The actual image was provided by the user in the prompt.
// I will use run_command to copy/move if it was saved to a temp path, 
// or I'll assume the system-provided path correctly points to it.
// Actually, I can see the image in the prompt, I'll use the systemProvidedPath in the test script.
